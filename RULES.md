# Rules & Guidelines for Toucaan.

Few of the important things in life to note before we toss around ourselves:

1. Never use !important on your CSS.
2. Keep portrait mode your first point of entry for styling of any new webpage.
3. The most ideal baseline is [Critical CSS](https://medium.com/web-standards/critical-css-39e479af038e) with an aim to keep the above-the-fold source under 14 KB (compressed) and with the quickest FCP.
4. Naming convention: Stick to full English words instead of shortforms or abbreviations.
5. Keep nesting CSS to a single level, avoid specificity hell.
6. Accessibility is essential.
