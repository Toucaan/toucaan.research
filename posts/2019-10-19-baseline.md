[Last update: October, 19<sup>th</sup> 2019.]


_‚ù• **TLDR**; This is the second chapter on my new book on a new CSS framework called [Toucaan](http://toucaan.com). In this chapter we look at a minimum set of rules that we will need to force consistency according to the [new landscape of the web]()._

_Modern web browsers too have evolved and gotten so much better that we no longer need a heavy-handed approach to force consistency across vendors. With Toucaan we will try to move away from traditional reset or reboot css and implement a simpler and lighter strategy instead. So, welcome to Toucaan‚Äîa tropical new CSS framework for the web, with fewer defaults, newer patterns and a much simpler cascade._



# The 'Two States' of Web Design.

Let's create a [blank page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookiza/toucaan/master/examples/example0.html) on your machine and load it on a desktop browser first. 


This is easy, simply jump into your terminal and:


```bash
$ touch example0.html     // Create a new file but do not write anything on it. 

$ chrome example0.html    // Open this 0 byte files on your favorite browser. 
```

What do you see on this blank page? 

Of course nothing, it is an all-white or an all-black blank page depending on your browser's defaults. Did you know that this blank web page is the _most_ responsive web page in the whole world wide web? 

No CSS or media query is required to adapt the UX/UI of a blank page on mobile or desktop or any other device on web. You can resize the browser to any aspect ratio and the blank web page will continue to scale perfectly and responsively.

<br>

<div class="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/viewports.png" alt="Major web devices." width="66%" style="max-width:100%;">
  <div class="super-small">Viewport rectangles of the browser window on resize.</div>
</div>

<br>

Well, of course a blank page is going to be responsive you'd say but this is a hypothetical situation Marvin, so let's turn the table over and orient the desktop in portrait mode instead:

<br>
<div class="two-third center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/desktop-portrait-landscape.png" width="100%" />
</div>
<br>

Now the desktop in portrait orientation is going to reveal a browser window that is longer in height and shorter in width‚Äîkind of like a mobile phone but on a much bigger piece of glass. In reality a very small group of people use desktops in portrait mode (mostly developers) but the usage is possible nevertheless. Use of portrait mode grows on tablets‚Äîwith about 60% iPad users preferring landscape over portrait where as the story flips completely on a smartphone where about \~96% people prefer the portrait mode over landscape depending on content. With Apple Watch, the tiniest of screens on web, I suspect that nearly 100% of usage would be in portrait mode given that the device is physical tied to the wrist that way. 

Here are some [graphs & stats](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/64749/are-ipads-used-horizontally-or-vertically) if you're interested.

On Tesla Model S the browser open in portrait orientation just like a desktop in portrait mode while on Model 3 it does so in landscape mode. Well this discussion kind of uncovers that all of the web is viewed in only two modes of orientation‚Äîportrait or landscape‚Äîand square is the geometric point of inflexion where the media query needs to switch from portrait to landscape and vice-versa. Interesting.

This also means that there are only **two states of design** on web no matter which device or orientation one may choose to consume web on. It is a hard cold fact that electronic screens are rectangular in shape‚Äîwell, [almost](https://bubblin.io/blog/notch)‚Äîand therefore, the point of inflexion for all style rules to switch mode should be where the viewport itself becomes a square and starts flexing in the other direction. Since there are hardly any devices in shape of a perfect square, mathematically speaking we can take it for granted that a webpage will either render in `portrait` mode or `landscape`.

And oh, oh, ICYMI, there is a lot more `math` coming into CSS in the near future so we'll have trigonometry at our disposal eventually!

## Kickstarting the code

Now that we have covered some ground for Toucaan to work on let's start wiring up all the ideas discussed above into code. Since a webpage can be rendered in only one of the two states of the viewport, either portrait or landscape, we'll begin with the following ruleset for our new framework:


```css
@media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
  :root { /* Portrait variables go here.  */ } 

  @import url('toucaan/portrait/portrait.css') only screen and (orientation: portrait);   
}

@media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {    
  :root { /* Landscape variables go here. */ }

  @import url('toucaan/landscape/landscape.css') only screen and (orientation: landscape); 
}
```

The twin code blocks above may not seem like much at this stage but this dual state switch is exactly what we are going to use to go about scaling our layout across all the web devices on the planet. Notice that we are using a standard asynchronous @import call to request only so much CSS that a given "viewport state" will require. On the desktop, this state of a given render will not change unless the browser window is resized or if the user decides to swivel the monitor over.

Organizing your CSS this way ensures that both "states" of every element that will render on the DOM have been considered and then we can be sure that the webpage will scale desirably across the entire spectrum of devices that are on the web. It also helps avoiding a gigantic `reset.css`/`reboot.css` which can be a pain on low-powered devices. So hang in there for a little bit and stand by for the next chapter on Toucaan in which we will take up baselining CSS across vendors and introduce scalable responsive typography without use of javascript. 

I have setup a tiny repository for [Toucaan](https://github.com/bookiza/toucaan) and checked-in all that is under experimentation right now. Feel free to star, jump-in, offer sage advice or contribute to Toucan!
