[Status: rough draft & incomplete]

[Last update: October, 24<sup>th</sup> 2019.]


_‚ù• **TLDR**; Modern web browsers have evolved a lot, and we are at a point where a heavy-handed reset or reboot css is no longer necessary. In this chapter of my book on the new CSS framework called [Toucaan](http://toucaan.com) we implement a much lighter & a fundamentally grounded strategy by uncovering the minimum ruleset that is required to force consistency across vendors as per the new [landscape](https://bubblin.io/blog/toucaan-introduction) of the web._

## Baselining CSS

In the last chapter we created a [blank file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookiza/toucaan/master/examples/example0.html) to test responsiveness of an empty page. That work perfect and it was easy enough to implement, we simply touched an empty file and [opened](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookiza/toucaan/master/examples/example0.html) it on a browser like Chrome:


```bash
$ touch example0.html     // Create a new file but do not write anything on it. 

$ chrome example0.html    // Open this 0 byte files on your favorite browser. 
```

Let us take it forward from this spot and **inspect** the same 0 bytes blank page on the console of your browser next. 

Press `‚åò+‚å•+I` keys if you are on Chrome & Mac.



<div class="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/blank-page.jpg" alt="Blank web page." width="100%" style="max-width:100%;">
  <div class="super-small">Blank webpage on the browser window.</div>
</div>


Voila!, you will see that even though our webpage was blank there are still some html elements rendered inside to display the blank page correctly. Every web browser will insert these _minimum_ html elements to a webpage automatically if missing. 

```html
<!-- Blank page as rendered on Chrome, Firefox, Brave & Safari (Desktop) -->
<html>
  <head></head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

Note, that the browser also applies a default user agent stylesheet<sup>\*</sup> called the `html.css` under the page. This html.css file is the default that every browser comes with on install. Back in the day this file used to contain several inconsistencies but that is no longer the case today. We can practically assume that the `html.css` itself has become the standard reset/reboot for our unset cascade now. 

Andy Bell shared a very interesting [reset](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/a-modern-css-reset/) css last week for a blog type of application, and even though it is limited in scope and applications, his reset kind of shows that there's very little arm twisting required over a browser to establish consistent interface. This is great news!

Since there are only three `html` elements that are a minimum requirement for a workable webpage, we will start baselining our CSS framework by resetting CSS only these three elements, if required:

    1. <html> tag or **:root** element,
    2. <body> tag, and the‚Ä¶ 
    3. <head> tag. 

Since the \<head\> element is always set to `display:none;` there are only two html tags <body> and <html> for us to dabble with. Here is what the new structure for our `reset.css` would look like for Toucaan:


```html

<style>

    @import url('toucaan/portrait/portrait.css') only screen and (orientation: portrait);

    @import url('toucaan/landscape/landscape.css') only screen and (orientation: landscape); 

    @media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
        :root { 
            /* Portrait variables go here.  */ 
        } 
    }

    @media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {    
        :root { 
            /* Landscape variables go here. */ 
        }
    }

    /* The minimum elements required on a valid webpage */
    html { }

    body { }


</style>

```

What this also means is that everything else that goes into building your application, the other html elements and the style properties that are specific to your app, will determine what other helpers or resets will be required to support the entire spectrum of browsers on the web. I'm guessing it wouldn't be a lot, but let's see where this will go.

Notice that I have inlined our portrait ‚áã landscape switch along with the html, body elements inside the `<style> ‚Ä¶ </style>` tag. We do this to ensure that [critical](https://css-tricks.com/annotating-critical-css/) [css](https://css-tricks.com/authoring-critical-fold-css/) is available for the first contentful paint (FCP) asap and also to declare all global css variables at one place. This is good for organization andsss maintainability.

> Some of you pointed me towards Steve Souder's article [don't use @import](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/09/dont-use-import/) from 2009 but I can confirm that this position is no longer valid. The fact that almost 50% of the web is on http/2 and that there is a possibility of hardcaching all of the CSS locally using a serviceworker, I think we are good to go with imports in 2020 and beyond. Besides, our little CSS import switch will request only one external CSS file for a given viewport state, just like a \<link\> url does.
>
> Feel free to dissect the position I have taken on using CSS @imports on Toucaan. But for now, I am happy to report that **not using CSS imports** to separate critical CSS from non-critical parts is likely an anti-pattern that we should do away with. Toko, toko! 

Now that we have a basic structure, let us add some meat to it. 

## The final result:

This is what our final `reset.css` would look like: 


```html

[Tentative]

<style>
    @charset "UTF-8";   /* Recommended reading: https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-charset.en */

    /* Option 1. Use 'privacy safe' self-hosted typefaces, or use‚Ä¶  */
    @font-face {
        font-family: "Font Family";
        src: url(data:font/opentype;base64, _font_subsetted_string_); 
        font-style: normal;
        font-weight: 300;
    }

    /* Option 2. Hosted typefaces such as from Google Fonts. */
    @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Font+Family:300,300i&display=swap); 

    @import url('toucaan/portrait/portrait.css') only screen and (orientation: portrait);

    @import url('toucaan/landscape/landscape.css') only screen and (orientation: landscape); 

    @media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
        :root { 
            --fs: calc(100vw/100); /* Tentative */
        } 
    }

    @media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {    
        :root { 
            --fs: calc((100vh * (1443/1115))/100);  /* Tentative */
        }
    }

    /* Sane defaults below */s
    *, *:after, *:before   {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        /* I have a feeling that using margin & padding on elements instead */
        /* of the flexbox is somewhat an anti-pattern now but I am not sure. */
        /* We will come back to this topic in sometime. */
        margin: 0;  
        padding: 0; 
    }

    html {
        background-color: white; /* Always set the background color */ 
        -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
        -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
        overflow-x: hidden;
        overflow-y: scroll;
        text-size-adjust: 100%;
    }

    body {
        font-size: calc(4 * var(--fs)); /* Theoretical a.t.m */
        font-family: 'Font Family', sans-serif; 
        font-smooth: always;
        font-weight: 300;   
        font-style: normal;
        font-synthesis: none;
        font-stretch: ultra-condensed;
        font-variant: no-common-ligatures proportional-nums slashed-zero;
        font-kerning: normal;
        text-rendering: geometricPrecision; /* Why not: text-rendering: optimizeSpeed;?‚Ä¶ in light of PWA. */
        font-display: swap;
        font-display: optional;

        -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
        -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;

        -webkit-font-smoothing: subpixel-antialiased;
        -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
        -webkit-osx-font-smoothing: antialiased;


        line-height: calc(1.5 * 4 * var(--fs));  /* Or 1.5 */

        /* Colors + contrast */
        color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.95);
        background-color: white;

        /* Dimensions */
        border: none;
        min-height: 100vh;


        /* Behavior */
        overflow: auto;
        -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
        scroll-behavior: smooth;
        touch-action: auto;
        display: grid; /* Grids are meant for layouts, flex are meant for element behavior! */
    }



    /* Accessibility specific media queries go below. */

    /* 1. Dark mode (or light) depending on requirement. */
    @media screen and (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
        body {
            background-color: #343434;
            color: #fff;
        }
    }

    /* 2. Override animations for users with motion sickness or other vestibular disorders. */
    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
        * {
            animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
            animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
            transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
            scroll-behavior: auto !important;
        }
    }

</style>

```

An intrinisically scalable layout with grids, responsive typography and behaviors separated along `portrait.css` & `landscape.css` according to the nature of rectangle we will be painting on. Quite a few rules on the reset above are experimental in nature. We'll dissect them going forward, step by step.

### A note about some of the vocabulary that we use today:

We generally refer to the dimensions of a client as to height and width, but really what we have above the fold is a simple rectangle with a length and breadth. Using height and width to label dimensions has been accurate during the desktop era where the monitor was usually mounted to display content along the vertical plane, but this terminology appears to be invalid with mobile and tablet. 


<br>
<div class="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/rectangles.jpg" alt="Portrait or landscape rectangles." width="100%" style="max-width:100%;">
  <br>
  <div class="small">Using length & breadth instead of height & width.</div>
</div>
<br>

In many situations we consume content while lying down on a sofa or looking down on a tablet lying flat on a table. Meaning, the screens are no longer restricted to displaying content along the vertical plane, and there height isn't a correct reference.

\*For the literature on Toucaan I'll sometimes use the mathematical labels _length_ and _breadth_ to refer to the rectangle instead of height and width. Here's an added bonus of doing so‚Äîwe exactly know that the shorter side is the breadth.

<br>

<div class="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/viewports.png" alt="Major web devices." width="66%" style="max-width:100%;">
  <br>
  <div class="small">Viewport rectangles of the browser in portrait or landscape.</div>
</div>

<br>

## Breaking it down

1. The first line on the Toucaan's reset is the charset declaration. See the w3c [recommendation](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-charset.en) on this one, which I quote:

> You should always use UTF-8 as the character encoding of your style sheets and your HTML pages, and declare that encoding in your HTML. If you do that, there is no need to declare the encoding of your style sheet.

This is done simply to guarantee encoding for the CSS parser to use just in case the end user forgets to declare the encoding on their html. 

2. The next block of code deals 

I just flat out reset all margin & padding on elements and pseudo-elements and force them to use **box-sizing: border-box**.

### Charset, typography & typesetting




Choosing typography for your application with Toucaan is simple. Toucaan recommends to host the typefaces you want to use (see Github [issue](https://github.com/bookiza/toucaan/issues/6)) for your webapp locally.  






I have updated the repository with this article and code on [Toucaan](https://github.com/bookiza/toucaan). Everything that is checked-in is currently experimental so feel free to question, star, jump-in or offer sage advice. 

Or better still, contribute to Toucaan if you can!
