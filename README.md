# toucaan css

Toucans are aggressive little birds that symbolize beauty and strength. But Toucaan is just CSS.

Similarly, Toucaan is theoretically a CSS framework that symbolizes beauty and strength; but more than that it relies on the most powerful tool we have as developers: Thinking.

Follow along for a set of rules that would potentially define your webpages: no matter which framework you choose or what you do to sprinkle style on your website.

Toucaan can also be very angry at times. Excuse the temper.

# Hate responsively!

The most responsive page in the whole world wide web is blank. A blank page would scale even on the iWatch if it were to sport a browser on it. Put in an alphabet or two, may be the text wouldn't scale but responsive it might still be. 

So just keep all that marketing peptalk aside and think up design without the buzzword.
