## Introduction

Unlike any other CSS framework, Toucaan is _mutative_ & _intrinsic_ by nature.
It is meant to design "app-like" web applications according to the [new landscape](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web) of the web.

1. By mutative, we mean that you can add/edit your own style rules directly into
the framework. There is no primary `reset.css` or secondary layout utility or
additional resources required for cross-browser compatibility.

2. By intrinsic, we mean that the designs "belongs to" the device the user is on.
Now this can mean a lot of things but unlike responsive, for example, Toucaan
doesn't use hardcoded pixel values on media-query to switch the interface between
mobile and the desktop. In fact, it doesn't even serve the styles needed on the
desktop media if the user is on mobile.

Toucaan uses several ultramodern CSS patterns and new defaults that are
mathematically grounded. It introduces‚Ä¶

1. Block-scoped typography, and,
2. Deterministic layouts,

‚Ä¶should you need to design your web-app with 'app-like' precision that isn't possible
with lose frameworks.

Toucaan is also careful about picking tribalistic-religious positions such as not
making a choice between CSS-grids or the flexbox. Use all you got, and whatever you like!



Keep your style semantic, searchable and mathematically sound. At all times!

## Getting Started

## Key features

1. Semantic layouts with CSS Grids.
2. Block-scoped typography
3. Deterministic layouts with inch:pixel mappings.
3. Support starts at Apple Watch 5 and goes all the way up to projectors and LCD TVs.
4. Powerful and yet simple reusable classes. Like writing style in plain English.
5. Easy to customize and theme about.


## Why call it Toucaan?

Quite simply because I owned the pretty domain name.

Besides that Toucan is a beautiful bird. This aggressive little arboreal _ramphastidus_ symbolizes both beauty and strength. We are not only going to found our CSS framework on the metaphor of this highly social and resilient bird but also implement a design language that covers support for all devices on the web including but not limited to just mobile or the desktop.

Occasionally, though only rarely, we may even spar with other CSS frameworks using our ‚Äúmean‚Äù oversized and colorful bill. üòâ

So‚Ä¶ say hello to Toucaan‚Äîthe tropical new CSS framework for the web. It's wild!

Repeat after me: **_Because if Toucaan, then you can too!_** üòâ
