## Introduction

Toucaan is a _mutative_ design framework for the
[new landscape](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web) of the web.

By mutative, it means you can add app styles directly on
the [baseline normalize](https://bubblin.io/blog/baseline-css) CSS of the framework.

Toucaan is based on CSS grids, flexbox, and block-scoped typography.

Create deterministic and performant UIs using geometrical precision,
semantic, accessible and mathematically grounded.

## Key features

1. Semantic layouts with CSS Grids.
2. Blockscoped typography with intelligent responsiveness.
3. Supports Apple Watch 5 upwards up-to OLED TVs, V9 browsers on Tesla and everything in-between.
4. Super reusable with utilities in natural English.
5. Easy to customize. Themable to make your app or website stand out.
6. Opinionated with real life usage and feedback.


## Why call it Toucaan?

Quite simply because I owned the pretty domain name.

Besides, Toucan is a beautiful bird. This aggressive little arboreal ramphastidus symbolizes both beauty and strength. We are not only going to found our CSS framework on the metaphor of this highly social and resilient bird but also implement a design language that covers support for all devices on the web including but not limited to just mobile phone or desktops.

Ocassionally‚Äîbut only rarely‚Äîwe may spar with other CSS frameworks using our ‚Äúmean‚Äù oversized and colorful bill. üòâ

So‚Ä¶ say hello to Toucaan‚ÄîThe Tropical CSS framework for the web.

And repeat after me: **_Because if Toucaan, then you can too!_** üòâ
