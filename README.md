# Introduction

Toucaan is an _intrinsic_ and _mutative_ CSS framework.
It is meant for "app-like" web interfaces meant for the [new landscape of the web](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web).

1. By mutative, we mean that you can add/edit your own style rules directly into
the framework. The concept borders near the idea of a framework-less and classless approach to CSS,
in that there is no heavy `reset` or `normalize.css` or a secondary utility or resource required to be imported for
cross-browser consistency.

2. By intrinsic, we mean that the designs "belongs to" the device the user is on.
Now, this can mean a lot of things but unlike responsive, for example, Toucaan
doesn't use hardcoded pixel values on media-query to switch the interface between
mobile and the desktop. In fact, it doesn't even serve the desktop CSS if the
user is on mobile so there is no query switching to happen.

Read more about [this](https://bubblin.io/blog/baseline-css).

Toucaan uses several ultramodern CSS patterns and new defaults that are
mathematically grounded. It introduces‚Ä¶

1. Block-scoped typography, and,
2. Deterministic layouts using the absolute [--inch](https://github.com/bookiza/--inch) (optional).

‚Ä¶should you need to design your web-app with 'app-like' precision that isn't possible
with loose frameworks.

Toucaan is also careful about avoiding tribalistic-religious positions such as _not_
picking between CSS-grids or the flexbox. Use all you got, and whenever you like!

> I have written a book on the [thoughts and reasoning](https://bubblin.io/cover/the-toucaan-framework-by-marvin-danig) behind Toucaan.

Buying the book helps me support the Toucaan CSS framework directly.

## Getting Started

Head over [here](https://www.toucaan.com/docs/getting-started).

### Key features

1. Semantic layouts with CSS Grids.
2. Block-scoped typography
3. Deterministic layouts with `inch:pixel` mappings (Optional).
4. Support starts at Apple Watch 5 and goes all the way up to projectors and LCD TVs.
5. Powerful and yet simple reusable classes. Like writing style in plain English.
6. Easy to customize and theme-ify.

### Browser Support

Preferably modern browsers that are inside of 2017 and now. Check-out [CSS Remedy](https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy)
to see how much debt you're willing to undertake for backwards-compatibility.

### Why call it Toucaan

Quite simply because I owned the pretty domain name.

Besides that Toucan is a beautiful bird. This aggressive little arboreal
_ramphastidus_ symbolizes both beauty and strength. We are not only going to found
our CSS framework on the metaphor of this highly social and resilient bird but also
implement a design language that covers support for all devices on the web including
but not limited to just mobile or the desktop.

Occasionally, though only rarely, we may even spar with other CSS frameworks
using our ‚Äúmean‚Äù oversized and colorful bill. üòâ

So‚Ä¶ say hello to Toucaan‚Äîthe tropical new CSS framework for the web. And repeat
after me: **_if Toucaan, then you can too!_** üòâ
