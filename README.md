## Introduction

Toucaan is a _mutative_ & _intrinsic_ css framework for modern web
applications according to the [new landscape](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web) of the web.

1. By mutative, we mean that you can add/edit your own style rules directly into
the framework. There is no secondary reset file or additional css to import than
what you'll be writing for your app. 

2. By intrinsic, we mean that even the baseline is modernized to a one that "belongs to the device" the user is on. Unlike the other CSS frameworks, Toucaan doesn't use a heavy reset file or even `normalize` under the hood because [this](https://bubblin.io/blog/baseline-css).

Toucaan uses ultramodern css patterns and new defaults that are mathematically grounded. For example, it doesn't make a choice between css grids or the flexbox. Use whatever you like! It however introduces both block-scoped typography and deterministic layouts should you need to design your apps with precision and 'app-like' behavior. 

Keep your style semantic, searchable and mathematically sound. At all times!

4. Powerful and yet simple reusable classes. Like writing style in plain English.
5. Easy to customize and theme about.


## Why call it Toucaan?

Quite simply because I owned the pretty domain name.

Besides that Toucan is a beautiful bird. This aggressive little arboreal _ramphastidus_ symbolizes both beauty and strength. We are not only going to found our CSS framework on the metaphor of this highly social and resilient bird but also implement a design language that covers support for all devices on the web including but not limited to just mobile or the desktop.

Occasionally, though only rarely, we may even spar with other CSS frameworks using our ‚Äúmean‚Äù oversized and colorful bill. üòâ

So‚Ä¶ say hello to Toucaan‚Äîthe tropical new CSS framework for the web. It's wild!

Repeat after me: **_Because if Toucaan, then you can too!_** üòâ
