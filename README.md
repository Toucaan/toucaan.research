5. Easy to customize. Themable to make your app or website stand out.

## Why call it Toucaan?

Quite simply because I owned the pretty domain name.

Besides, Toucan is a beautiful bird. This aggressive little arboreal ramphastidus symbolizes both beauty and strength. We are not only going to found our CSS framework on the metaphor of this highly social and resilient bird but also implement a design language that covers support for all devices on the web including but not limited to just mobile phone or desktops.

Ocassionally‚Äîbut only rarely‚Äîwe may spar with other CSS frameworks using our ‚Äúmean‚Äù oversized and colorful bill. üòâ

So‚Ä¶ say hello to Toucaan‚ÄîThe Tropical CSS framework for the web.

And repeat after me: **_Because if Toucaan, then you can too!_** üòâ
