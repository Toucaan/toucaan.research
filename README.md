# Introducing Toucaan CSSâ€¦

A tropical CSS framework for scalable web applications. It's full of *fun facts*, interesting patterns and new world CSS.

# Why Toucaan?

Say loud: **_If Toucaan, then you can too!_**

# Humble beginnings and a plan

Did you know that the most responsive page in the whole world wide web is *[blank](https://toucaan.com/example1.html)*. Try.

Good, so we're in a creative mood already. We'll write this high energy framework with just one rule on the top of our mind:

> Never tell the browser to do something that it is already doing. 

Yep. Minimal code, zero hardcoding, fewer style rules and a colorful spandex style stretchy responsive outcome that works just about everywhere. This is the plan.

### Why Toucaan, you may ask again?

You see Toucans are aggressive little birds that symbolize beauty and strength. We are going to base our framework on this highly social and smart bird, implement a structure that covers the wilderness on web and ocassionally, though rarely, spar with other CSS frameworks using a huge mean bill. The intent is to weed out all the unwanted CSS that your new website will never need.

Technically speaking, Toucaan is *not* a CSS framework to begin with but a journey on towards finding a new set of patterns or *none at all* that work on modern web. It relies completely on the most powerful tool we humans have as developers: Thinking.

In fact [you might not need a CSS framework!](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/you-might-not-need-a-css-framework/);


### Here are some of the advantages:

Stop making the browser recalculate style in several steps. Normalize it with the final look and feel.

#### For example:




#### Grid with Flexbox?

Why you incarcerate? Please stop putting innocent elements behind thos ugly bars.Toucaan can be very angry at this. Excuse the temper.


So just keep all that marketing peptalk aside and think up design without the buzzword.
