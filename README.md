A tropical CSS framework for scalable web applications. 

## Why Toucaan?

Toucaan is full of *fun facts*, interesting patterns and great documentation to style apps of the new world.

Repeat after me: **_If Toucaan, then you can too!_**

### A humble beginning…

Did you know that the most responsive page in the whole world wide web is *[blank](examples/example1.html)*. Try.

Good, so we're in a creative mood already. We'll write this high energy framework with just one rule on the top of our mind:

> Never tell the browser to do something that it is already doing.

Yep. Minimal code, no hardcoded values, fewer style rules and a colorful 'spandex type' stretchy responsive outcome that works just about everywhere. This is the plan.

### Why Toucaan, you may ask again?

You see Toucans are aggressive little birds that symbolize beauty and strength. We are going to base our framework on this highly social and resilient bird to implement a structure that covers all the wilderness on web. Ocassionally, though rarely, we might even spar with other CSS frameworks using a mean oversized bill.

Qualitatively speaking, the intent of Toucaan is to weed out all the unwanted CSS that your web app doesn't need.

In many ways Toucaan is *not* a CSS framework to begin with. It is a journey towards finding a newer pattern (or *none at all*) for styling our application in a way that scales. We are relying heavily on the most important lessons we discovered during design and development of other frameworks.

Fun fact #1: [You might not need a CSS framework!](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/you-might-not-need-a-css-framework/);
