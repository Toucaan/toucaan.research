## Introduction

Toucaan is a free and open source _mutative_ design framework based on CSS grids. It is easy-to-use, logical and mathematically grounded.

Repeat after me: **_Because if Toucaan, then you can too!_** üòâ


## Key features

1. Semantic layouts with CSS Grids.
2. Blockscoped typography with intelligent responsiveness.
3. Supports Apple Watch 5 upwards up-to OLED TVs, V9 browsers on Tesla and everything in-between.
4. Super reusable with utilities in natural English.
5. Easy to customize. Themable to make your app or website stand out.
6. Opinionated with real life usage and feedback!


## TODOs:

1. ~~Set up a documentation website via netlify (repo [here](https://github.com/bookiza/toucaan.gatsby.site). Immediate help required!)~~
2. ~~Typesetting/layout still improper on the [Superbook](https://github.com/marvindanig/toucaan-story-of-style).~~
3. ~~A place where people can opiniate/scream etc.~~ [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
4. Test suite?
5. Sem-Ver?


#### Why Toucaan, asketh the sunbaked developer!

Quite simply because I owned the pretty domain name.

Besides that, Toucan is a beautiful bird.
The aggressive little arboreal ramphastidus symbolizes both beauty and strength and we are going to found our CSS framework on the metaphor of this highly social and resilient bird to implement a design language that will cover support for all the devices on the web and not just smartphones or desktops.
Ocassionally‚Äîbut only rarely‚Äîwe may even spar with other CSS frameworks using our ‚Äúmean‚Äù oversized and colorful bill. üòâ

Say hello to Toucaan‚Äîa tropical CSS framework for the web.
