# Toucaan CSS

A tropical CSS framework for scalable web applications. It's full of *fun facts*, interesting patterns and new world CSS.

## Why Toucaan?

Say loud: **_If Toucaan, then you can too!_**

## Humble beginnings and a plan

Did you know that the most responsive page in the whole world wide web is *[blank](https://toucaan.com/example1.html)*. Try.

Good, so we're in a creative mood already. We'll write this high energy framework with just one rule on the top of our mind:

> Never tell the browser to do something that it is already doing. 

Yep. Minimal code, zero hardcoding, fewer style rules and a colorful spandex style stretchy responsive outcome that works just about everywhere. This is the plan.

### Why Toucaan, you may ask again?

You see Toucans are aggressive little birds that symbolize beauty and strength. We are going to base our framework on this highly social and smart bird, implement a structure that covers the wilderness on web and ocassionally, though rarely, spar with other CSS frameworks using a huge mean bill. The intent is to weed out all the unwanted CSS that your new web app will never need.

Technically speaking, Toucaan is *not* a CSS framework to begin with but a journey on towards finding a new set of patterns or *none at all* that work on modern web. It relies completely on the most powerful tool we humans have as developers: Thinking.

In fact [you might not need a CSS framework!](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/you-might-not-need-a-css-framework/);


#### It's not about Grid vs. Flexbox

Toucaan is sensitive about this, but excuse his temper. It's not about versus. It's about knowing when to use which.


So let's just keep all of that pep-talk aside and think up web design without falling for buzzwords.
